email address where you'll receive messages<br>

After you save and confirm the email address where you'd like to receive messages, you can give out self-destructing disposable email addresses whenever you want as follows:

<p align="center"><i>someword.x.user</i>@spamgourmet.com</p>

where <i>someword</i> is a word you haven't used before, <i>x</i> is the number of email messages you want to receive at the address (up to 20), and <i>user</i> is your username.  For example, if your username is 'spamcowboy', and you give this address to somebody
(or, more probably, some thing):

<p align="center">spamelope.2.spamcowboy@spamgourmet.com</p>

the address will be created here the first time it is <i>used</i>, and you'll receive at most two messages (forwarded to the email address you specify above) on the address.  The rest will be indelicately consumed.<br><br>
That's it.  You won't ever have to come back here.
